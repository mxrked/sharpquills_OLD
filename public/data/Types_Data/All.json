    "typeText": "The Four-toed hedgehog (Atelerix albiventris) is a diminutive African species characterized by its distinctive four toes on the hind feet. Native to central and eastern Africa, this nocturnal mammal boasts a spiky coat of quills and has the ability to curl into a protective ball when feeling threatened. Due to its small size and gentle temperament, the Four-toed hedgehog has become a popular choice as an exotic pet."
